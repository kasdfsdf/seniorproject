Senior Project

The NFL is arguably the most popular sports league in America, with a massive digital presence
that extends far beyond the field. Reddit’s r/nfl community alone boasts over 12 million users,
making it a valuable resource for understanding fan sentiment in real time. This project
explores how NFL teams are perceived on Reddit during the 2024 season and whether that
online sentiment has any measurable impact on real-world outcomes. We collect and analyze
Reddit comments from the duration of the 2024 NFL season mentioning all 32 NFL teams,
using three natural language processing tools—VADER, NRC, and AFINN—to assess the
positivity or negativity of fan sentiment for each team. We then investigate whether these
sentiment scores are predictive of key indicators of team performance and value, including
win percentage, average stadium attendance, and franchise valuation. Finally, we explore the
concept of “overhype”—instances where teams receive disproportionately positive sentiment
relative to their on-field results using fixed effects modeling and k-means clustering. Our
analysis offers insight into the influence of online fan discourse in shaping narratives around
NFL teams and its potential role in driving engagement and valuation
